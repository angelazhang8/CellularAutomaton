Loosely Modelling Heat Transfer Using A Taxation System

This automaton models the spread of heat in a substance using some of the principles from finance. By simplifying the complex physics involved in heat transfer to the rules of a taxation system, interesting effects can be observed. In this model, the transfer of heat is treated like as the transfer of money. 

The basic structure of a taxation system is that wealthier individuals are taxed money to help the less wealthy. The taxation system is similar to heat transfer because hot objects emit heat, that is then transferred to surrounding objects or throughout the object itself. Objects only transfer heat if there is a difference in heat energy between the objects. Hotter objects transfer heat to cooler objects. Hotter objects if given a choice, also transfer more heat to a colder object than an object that is only slightly cooler than itself.
